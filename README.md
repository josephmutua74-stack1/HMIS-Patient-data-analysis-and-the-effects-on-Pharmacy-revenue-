### Project Tittle
HMIS data analysis using power bi
### Description
This project analyzes the relationship between patient visits and total days stayed at the hospital to gauge their effect on hospital pharmacy revenue using Power BI to support operational decision-making
The project also seeks to gauge diagnosi across various counties
### Problem Statement
Despite an increase in patient visits, and lengthy stays in hospitals, this has not  translated to improved pharmacy revenue. This project explores the reasons behind this trend.

### Objective
  1. Analyze patient visit trends vs Pharmacy revenue
  2. Measure pharmacy revenue performance
  3. Identify revenue per visit patterns
  4. Which diseases are most common across counties?
  5. Department vs revenue generated
  6. length of hospital stay vs revenue output
  
### Data source
The data was loaded  from an excell workbook

### Tools used
  1. Power bi
  2. DAX
  3. Power query
  4. Excell hospital data as the data source.
### Data model
Star schema was used with patient data table being the fact table with visits and pharmacy revenue dimension tables.

### KPIs 
_Total hospital visits
Total pharmacy Revenue
Average length of stay_

### Dashboards
The dashboard allows users to filter by _Date(Months), department, and County _to explore trends and performance drivers.
### Insights and Findings
### Common diseases across counties
-Across Kiambu County Typhoid was the most common disease with a total visit count of 59 with highest peaks being Marcha and November
-In Nakuru and Uasin Gishu counties, Typhoid was the most common disease with spikes in April and August to September in Uasin Gishu county and highest in September in Nakuru county
-In Kisumu county Hypertrnsion was the most prevalent disease with a peak in the month of June and slightly high in March
-In Mombasa county Diabetes was the most common diagnosis with a highest spike in the month of June and August
-In Nairobi county, Penumonia was the most common disease, with peaks in the colder months of July to August
### Department vs revenue generated
Across the counties, Inpatient department generated the most revenue
### Identify revenue per visit patterns
Across the counties, higher number of hospital visits translated to high pharmacy revenue.
### Age groups vs medicine consumption in quantity
Across the counties, the 70-80 Age groups consumed the hughest number of drugs in quantities
### length of hospital stay vs revenue output
Across the counties, a lengthy stay in the hospital, did not translate to higher revenue.
This varies greatly per diagnosis,for instance, Flu and pneumonia had lengthy stays that did not translate to high revenue.
